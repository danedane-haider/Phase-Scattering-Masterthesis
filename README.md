# Aspects of Time-Frequency Scattering and Towards Phase Scattering - Master's Thesis
The repository contains all the content around my Master's Thesis on the scattering transform, i.e. audio files, matlab scripts, a paper contribution for the CMMR19 and of course, the thesis itself. To run the matlab scripts, the LTFAT toolbox is required, available under https://ltfat.github.io/.
